# Technical Analysis: Bionic Owl Wing Airfoil

## Introduction

This document provides technical details of my computational study on a bionic airfoil based on owl wing geometry. The analysis compares the performance of this bionic design with a standard NACA 0006 airfoil at Reynolds number 12,300.

## Methodology

### Airfoil Geometry Creation

The bionic airfoil was created based on the cross-section of an owl wing. Key geometric features include:

- Chord length: 24.0 mm
- Maximum thickness: 5.5% at x/c = 0.11
- Distinctive deep concave lower surface
- Thin trailing edge section (thickness < 3% for x/c > 0.3)

I extracted the coordinates from published research and developed a parametric model of the airfoil. The NACA 0006 airfoil was generated using standard equations for comparison.

### Computational Setup

#### Mesh Generation
For accurate results, I created a C-type structured mesh with careful refinement near the airfoil surface:

- Total grid size: 1.7 × 10^6 cells
- y+ < 1 to properly capture the boundary layer
- Grid independence study performed to ensure solution accuracy
- Domain size: 30c upstream, 30c downstream, 30c in crosswise directions

#### Solver Configuration
I used ANSYS Fluent 14.0 with the following settings:

- Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with WALE subgrid-scale model
- Pressure-based solver
- Second-order upwind scheme for convection terms
- Second-order central difference scheme for diffusion terms
- Second-order implicit scheme for time advancement
- Time step: 1.0 × 10^-5 s
- 20 iterations per time step
- 5000 total time steps for each angle of attack

#### Boundary Conditions
- Inlet: Velocity inlet (7.5 m/s)
- Outlet: Pressure outlet (101325 Pa)
- Airfoil surface: No-slip, adiabatic wall
- Spanwise direction: Periodic boundary conditions

### Analysis Approach

I conducted simulations at seven angles of attack (0°, 1.5°, 3°, 4.5°, 6°, 7.5°, 9°) for both the bionic and NACA 0006 airfoils. For each case, I:

1. Monitored lift and drag coefficients until statistical convergence
2. Identified flow separation and reattachment points
3. Analyzed the pressure distribution on the airfoil surface
4. Extracted acoustic sources from the unsteady flow field
5. Applied the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) equation to predict sound propagation

#### Acoustic Analysis
For acoustic analysis, I:

1. Placed 12 receiver points at 15c distance from the airfoil
2. Extracted time-varying pressure data from the simulation
3. Calculated the A-weighted sound pressure levels
4. Analyzed the frequency spectrum and directivity patterns
5. Studied the distribution of dP/dt on the airfoil surface to identify acoustic sources

## Results and Discussion

### Aerodynamic Performance

The bionic airfoil demonstrated significantly better performance than the NACA 0006:

| Angle of Attack | Cl (Bionic) | Cd (Bionic) | L/D (Bionic) | Cl (NACA) | Cd (NACA) | L/D (NACA) |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 0°              | 0.32        | 0.041       | 7.8          | 0.0       | 0.040     | 0.0        |
| 1.5°            | 0.40        | 0.037       | 10.8         | 0.25      | 0.050     | 5.0        |
| 3.0°            | 0.62        | 0.050       | 12.4         | 0.45      | 0.060     | 7.5        |
| 4.5°            | 0.78        | 0.052       | 15.0         | 0.65      | 0.070     | 9.3        |
| 6.0°            | 0.92        | 0.060       | 15.3         | 0.82      | 0.080     | 10.2       |
| 7.5°            | 1.02        | 0.070       | 14.6         | 0.85      | 0.100     | 8.5        |
| 9.0°            | 1.12        | 0.083       | 13.5         | 0.78      | 0.100     | 7.8        |

The maximum lift-to-drag ratio for the bionic airfoil was 15.3 at 6° AOA, compared to 10.2 for the NACA 0006, representing a 50% improvement.

### Flow Separation Characteristics

The flow separation patterns showed interesting behavior:

- At low AOA (0-1.5°): Separation occurred on the pressure side due to the concave geometry
- Around 3°: A transition occurred where separation shifted from pressure side to suction side
- At high AOA (6-9°): The separation region on the suction side increased with angle
- At 9°: Complete separation from the leading edge on the suction side

### Acoustic Performance

The acoustic analysis revealed:

- Sound pressure levels (SPL) ranged from 3.9 dB to 28.3 dB with an average of 21.7 dB
- Peak SPL of 22.6 dB occurred at a frequency of 192 Hz
- The directivity pattern showed dipole-like characteristics
- Maximum dP/dt values appeared at the trailing edge of the airfoil

## Conclusions

The bionic airfoil based on owl wing geometry demonstrates superior aerodynamic performance compared to the standard NACA 0006 airfoil. The unique features of the owl wing, particularly the deep concave lower surface, contribute to higher lift-to-drag ratio across the range of angles of attack studied.

The flow separation characteristics are highly dependent on the angle of attack, with a distinctive transition from pressure side to suction side separation as the angle increases. This behavior affects both the aerodynamic performance and acoustic signature of the airfoil.

The acoustic analysis confirms that the sound generation is primarily concentrated at the trailing edge, where the maximum pressure fluctuations occur. The sound field shows a dipole-like directivity pattern with peak intensity at a relatively low frequency.

These findings demonstrate the potential benefits of biomimetic design principles in improving both the efficiency and noise characteristics of airfoils for applications such as multiblade centrifugal fans.
